# Changelog

Notable changes to CatColab will be documented in this file.

Since CatColab is first and foremost an application, not a library, the project
does not follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Major versions are
released when enough significant new features are accumulated to justify an
announcement and a blog post. Minor versions are not announced but allow
features and fixes to be pushed out with greater frequency. Minor versions often
include notable new features.
