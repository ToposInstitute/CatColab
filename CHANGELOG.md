# Changelog

Notable changes to CatColab will be documented in this file.

Since CatColab is first and foremost an application, not a library, we do not
follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Major versions are released
when enough significant new features are accumulated to justify an announcement
and a blog post. Minor versions are not announced but allow new features and
fixed to pushed out with greater frequency.
