\p{A \nlab{promonad} is succinctly defined as a monad in the bicategory of
profunctors. Its interest lies in being equivalently an identity-on-objects
functor, used to model categorical structures with a two-level hierarchy of
morphisms on the same objects.}

\p{A model of this theory is precisely a promonad. For a proof, see the blog
post [Patterson 2024](promonads-are-algebras-2024).}
