\p{A multisorted \nlab{Lawvere theory} is a finite-product theory with a
distinguished set of generating objects/types. This idea can be formulated
precisely in a couple of ways; here is [Todd Trimble's
definition](https://ncatlab.org/toddtrimble/published/multisorted+Lawvere+theories).}

\p{Just as a [finite-product double theory](double-products-2024) is a
categorification of a finite-product theory, so should a "double Lawvere theory"
be a categorification of a Lawvere theory. Since we think of a double theory as
having both object types (its objects) and morphism types (its proarrows), a
multisorted double Lawvere theory ought to have both \em{object sorts} and
\em{morphism sorts}. But stating this definition is more complicated than simply
replacing the family construction with the double family construction, because
the source or target of a morphism sort must be a finite family of object sorts
rather than a single sort. For now we make the following incomplete definition.}
