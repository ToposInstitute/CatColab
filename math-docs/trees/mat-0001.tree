\title{Introduction}

\p{
  As the name suggests, CatColab is based on mathematical ideas from category
  theory. It is a specific design goal that the system be usable \em{without}
  any knowledge of such ideas. These docs are for people who want to know about
  the mathematics, perhaps because they want to develop the core package
  [catlog](/dev/rust/catlog/) or just out of curiosity. At the moment, these
  pages are from being a self-contained introduction, serving mainly to collect
  new bits of CatColab-related mathematics as they are created. For proper
  exposition, see the [published literature](bib-0001).
}

\p{
  In mathematical terms, CatColab is an editor for categorical structures and
  their morphisms and higher morphisms. The meta-logical framework organizing
  these categorical structures is based on [double category
  theory](https://mathoverflow.net/q/476936). More precisely, the
  \strong{domain-specific logics} in CatColab are defined by [double
  theories](cartesian-double-theories-2024), and the \strong{models} in
  CatColab are models of double theories.
}

\p{
  The library of domain-specific logics in CatColab is inspired by a wide body
  of research in applied category theory and beyond. Incomplete bibliographies
  are in [these docs](bib-0003) and the [\code{catlog}
  docs](https://next.catcolab.org/dev/rust/catlog/refs).
