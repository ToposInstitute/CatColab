\p{
    The free monoid monad #{\List} on \Set extends, since (as a polynomial functor) 
    it preserves pullbacks, to a pseudo double monad, also called \List, on 
    the double category \Span of sets and spans. Concretely, to apply #{\List} to a span 
    #{A\leftarrow S\to B}, you just compose this span, seen as a functor #{\bullet\leftarrow \bullet\to \bullet\to\Set},
    with #{\List}, and similarly for the unit and multiplication. (This is always how you get a colax double
    functor on spans out of a functor between categories with pullbacks; the pseudo-ness is equivalent to 
    preservation of those pullbacks.)
