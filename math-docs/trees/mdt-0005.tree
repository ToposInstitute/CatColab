\title{Algebra over a double monad}

\p{
    If #{w',w} are comparable [mdt-0004]{weaknesses} and #{(T,\mu,\eta):\dbl{D}\to\dbl{D}} is a #{w}-double monad, then a #{w'}-algebra over #{T} 
    is a #{w'}-double functor #{X:\dbl{1}\to \dbl{D}} equipped with a tight natural transformation #{\xi:T\circ X\to X}
    satisfying the usual algebra laws, i.e. #{\xi\circ (\eta x)=\id_x} and #{\xi\circ (\mu x)=(\xi\circ (t\xi))}. (That is, it is 
    a #{T}-module carried by #{X} in the 2-category #{\Dbl_{\mathrm{max}(w,w')}}. Note that these are all "strict algebras" in 
    the sense of the formal theory of monads, i.e. the algebra laws are satisfied on the nose.) By default, we'll assume #{w=w'}.
}

\p{
    If #{w'=s}, then an algebra is just a (strict) algebra over the 2-monad induced by #{T} on the vertical 2-category of #{\dbl{D}}.
    But by increasing #{w'} we can get quite interesting algebras even for double monads whose base has a boring vertical 2-category, like \Span:
}

\p{
    If #{w'=w=\ell}, then the carrier #{X} is a category object in #{\dbl{D}}, consisting of an endo-proarrow #{X_1:X_0\proto X_0} plus 
    the unitor #{i_X:\id_{X_0}\to X_1} and the laxator #{l_X:X_1\circ X_1\to X_1} satisfying associativity and unitality.
}
\p{
    The algebra structure has components #{\xi_0:T(X_0)\to X_0} and

	{TX_0} & {TX_0} \\
	{X_0} & {X_0}

	\arrow["{\xi_0}"{description}, from=1-1, to=2-1]
	\arrow["{\xi_0}"{description}, from=1-2, to=2-2]
	\arrow[""{name=1, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "{X_1}"{inner sep=.8ex}, "\shortmid"{marking}, from=2-1, to=2-2]
	\arrow["{\xi_1}"{description}, draw=none, from=0, to=1]
\end{tikzcd}}
    which constitute #{T_i}-algebra structures on #{X_0} and #{X_1} respectively.
}

\p{
    As with any natural transformation between lax functors out of #{\dbl{1}}, #{\xi_0} and #{\xi_1} together constitute a functor between the 
    category objects. Thus we can see an #{\ell}-algebra over #{T} precisely as a #{T}-algebra structure on a category object in #{\dbl{D}}, carried 
    by a functor. 
}

\p{
    In particular, when the double monad #{T} is naturally induced by a pullback-preserving monad #{T:\cat{E}\to \cat{E}} on a category #{\cat{E}} with 
    pullbacks, then #{T_1} is essentially just #{T} again, and an #{\ell}-algebra over #{T} is a category in #{\dbl{Span}(\cat{E})}
    with #{T}-algebra structures on objects and arrows such that source and target are algebra homomorphisms and the algebra maps 
    comprise a functor #{T(X)\to X}. Thus while an #{s}-algebra over the free monoid monad on \Span is a monoid, an #{\ell}-algebra is a strict monoidal category.
