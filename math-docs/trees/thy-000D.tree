\p{The \define{theory of categories with pullbacks} is presented by an object
#{x} plus data making the arrow ##{\pi_1: \top \id_x \to x,} the target
projection of the tabulator of #{\id_x}, be an interpreted as fibration.}

\p{According to the [theory of fibrations](thy-000C), the latter data consists
of an arrow ##{\pb: \top \pi_1^* \to \top \id_x} along with cells and equations
making \pb the right part of an adjunction sliced over #{\top \id_x}.}

\p{Thanks to Corinthia Aberl√© for suggesting this theory.}
