\title{Algebras over the free monoid double monad}

\p{
    An #{s}-algebra for the free monoid double monad #{T:\Span\to \Span} is a monoid. An #{\ell}-algebra is 
    a strict monoidal category: a category with monoid structures on the objects and arrows such that source 
    and target are monoid homomorphisms and the monoid operations comprise a functor from the category of 
    lists.
