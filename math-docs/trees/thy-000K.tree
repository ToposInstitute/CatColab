Given a strict monoidal category \catV, the \define{theory of #{\catV}-graded
categories} is the delooping double category #{\mathbb{B}(\catV)}. That is, it
is the simple double theory with trivial category of objects and arrows, and
proarrows and cells given by the objects and morphisms of \catV, respectively.
External composition in #{\mathbb{B}(\catV)} is the monoidal product in \catV.
