\def\Sgn{#{\operatorname{Sgn}}}

\p{A [signed category](reg-nets-2024) is a category graded by signs. To be more
precise, let #{\Sgn \coloneqq \{\pm 1\} \cong \Z_2} be the group of nonzero
signs under their usual multiplication.}

\definition{Signed category}{
  \p{A \define{signed category} a category \cat{A} along
  with a functor #{\cat{A} \to \Sgn}, viewing \Sgn as a one-object category.}
  \p{These are the objects of the slice category #{\cat{Cat}/\Sgn},
  the \define{category of signed categories}.}
