\p{The \define{theory of promonoids} #{\mathbb{T}_{\mathrm{pm}}} is the cartesian double theory generated by an object #{x} 
equipped with proarrows #{\mu_2:x^2 \proto x,\mu_0:x^0\proto x}, subject to associativity and unitality conditions. In other words, there is a unique counary proarrow #{\mu_n:x^n\to x} for every #{n}. (see [Lambert &
Patterson 2024](cartesian-double-theories-2024), Theory 6.9.)}

\p{Arbitrary proarrows #{p:x^m\proto x^n} thus must be a product of #{n} proarrows 
#{\mu_{m_i}:x^{m_i}\to x} for some partition #{m=m_1+\cdots +m_n} of #{m}. Thus the loose
category of #{\mathbb{T}_{\mathrm{pm}}} is the augmented simplex category, the category
of totally-ordered, possibly-empty finite sets and order-preserving maps between them. This 
phenomenon is familiar from the fact that the augmented simplicial category is itself the 
strict monoidal category freely generated by a monoid object. Compare [Pisani 2024](pisani-2024) for a theory of multicategories in which the pro-arrows are instead maps of sets with orders 
on the fibers only, for better comparison with symmetric multicategories.}

\p{Its models in #{\Span} are multicategories: #{x} maps to the object set
#{M_0} of the multicategory and #{\mu_n} maps to the span #{M_0^n\proto 
M_0} whose value at #{((x_i)_1^n,y)} we interpret as the set of 
multimorphisms #{(x_i)\to y}.}
