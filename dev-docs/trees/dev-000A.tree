\title{Backend design}

\subtree{
\title{Concepts and overview}

\p{The main pieces of state in the backend are the SQL [database](dev-000B) and
an in-memory hash map from [refs](dev-000D) to Automerge [document
handles](https://automerge.org/docs/repositories/dochandles/). The important
thing to realize is that nothing from Automerge is persisted through a restart
of the backend; the only thing that is persisted are serializations of the
Automerge documents at different points in time. Thus, when the server restarts,
clients must request new document handles. (Currently, this is not implemented:
you must refresh the client after a server restart.)}

\p{With this in mind, we outline the database schema and the operations
currently supported on the backend.}

\title{Capabilities of the backend}

\p{The backend has the following current and future capabilities.}

\p{\strong{Currently implemented RPC API:}}

\ul{
\li{\strong{Mutation}: \code{new_ref(content: any): string}. Creates a new
[ref](dev-000D) with the given initial content. Returns the ID of the newly
created ref as a string representation of the UUID.}

\li{\strong{Query}: \code{doc_id(ref_id: string): string}. Returns the Automerge
document ID associated with the given ref. If the hash map in the backend
doesn't contain an association for that ref, then a fresh document handle is
created with initial state given by the current autosave for that ref.}

\li{\strong{Query}: \code{head_snapshot(ref_id: string): any}. Gets the content
of the current head of a ref. The result is a plain JSON object, not a live
Automerge document.}

\li{\strong{Mutation}: \code{save_snapshot(ref_id: string, content: any)}. Saves
the ref with the given content, as described in [refs](dev-000D).}
}

\p{\strong{API to implement in the future:}}

\ul{
\li{Searching for refs via their metadata.}
\li{Displaying all of the snapshots for a ref, sorted by timestamp.}
}
}
}

\subtree{
\title{Implementation}

\p{The backend consists of two services running in independent processes
(possibly on different machines).

\ol{
\li{\strong{Web server}, written in Rust}
\li{\strong{Automerge document server}, written in TypeScript and running in Node}
}

The services communicate bidirectionally using [SocketIO](https://socket.io/), a
simple protocol that extends WebSockets with niceties such as automatic
reconnection and message acknowledgments.}

\subtree{
\title{Dependencies}

\p{Without attempting to be exhaustive, we summarize the backend's most
important dependencies.}

\p{\strong{Web server} uses the crates:

\ul{

\li{[\code{axum}](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum): web application framework
built on the popular [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/) stack}

\li{[\code{rspc}](https://www.rspc.dev/) with its \code{rspc-axum} integration:
generates a type-safe RPC client for the frontend}

\li{[\code{sqlx}](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx): type-safe queries for
Postgres (and other SQL databases)}

\li{[\code{socketioxide}](https://github.com/Totodore/socketioxide): Rust
implementation of a SocketIO server}

}}

\p{\strong{Automerge document server} uses the packages:

\ul{

\li{[\code{automerge-repo}](https://github.com/automerge/automerge-repo/):
Manages the websocket-based syncing of Automerge documents. Note that we do
\em{not} use its storage facilities. That's what the database is for. We would
prefer to use
[\code{automerge-repo-rs}](https://github.com/automerge/automerge-repo-rs), the
Rust implementation of the protocol, but at the time of this writing it is not
stable. That's why this service is written in TypeScript instead of Rust.}

\li{[\code{express}](https://expressjs.com/): The default choice of web
framework for a Node.js server. We use it only to upgrade from HTTP to the
WebSocket protocol.}

\li{\code{socket.io-client}: The official client for the SocketIO protocol.}

}}

}
}

\subtree{
\title{Infrastructure}

\p{We have an AWS server that is pointed to by the domain name backend-next.catcolab.org. This runs an instance of the backend. This backend can be used by the frontend hosted at next.catcolab.org, or by a dev server. Note that this means that PR previews only are for the frontend. So if a PR introduces significant changes to the backend, the PR preview won't see those backend changes because it will still be pointing to whatever version of the backend is running on the server. Fortunately, we don't expect the backend to change all too much, at least compared to the frontend; it just serves blobs without caring about what's in the blobs.}

\p{The system configuration of this server is configured via nix, in the \code{infrastructure/} part of the repo. In order to change the system configuration, make sure that your ssh key is enabled for root access to the server (ask Owen for this). Then run:}

\ol{
\li{\code{nix develop}}
\li{\code{deploy .#catcolab}}
}

\p{However, this will not update the version of catcolab that is running on the server. There is currently a somewhat manual process to do this, because Owen believes that it is important for people to understand the steps of the manual process so that they can debug things when they go wrong.}

\p{On backend-next.catcolab.org, there is a git clone of the catcolab repository in \code{/var/lib/catcolab}. There is a daemon (managed via systemd) that runs \code{node dist/index.js} in \code{/var/lib/catcolab/packages/backend}. In order to upgrade the version of catcolab that is running on the server, one should:}
\ol{
\li{Log in via \code{ssh root@backend-next.catcolab.org}. If you don't have access, ask Evan.}
\li{Use \code{su - catcolab} to become the user \code{catcolab}.}
\li{\code{cd} into \code{/var/lib/catcolab/packages/backend}.}
\li{Use \code{git} to checkout the desired version of catcolab.}
\li{Run \code{pnpm run build} to produce a new \code{dist/index.js} file.}
\li{Run \code{sudo systemctl stop catcolab}; this will temporarily stop the backend.}
\li{Run \code{catcolab-migrate.sh}. This will update the database with new any migrations that have been added since the last time the database was migrated.}
\li{Run \code{sudo systemctl start catcolab}; this will start back up the backend.}
\li{(If there are no new migrations, the previous three commands can simply be accomplished via \code{sudo systemctl restart catcolab})}
\li{You can check the status of the catcolab daemon with \code{systemctl status catcolab}, or look at the log messages with \code{journalctl -eu catcolab}.}
}

\p{To give a new user access to the servers:}
\ol{
\li{Update the public keys in \code{infrastructure/hosts/catcolab/default.nix}.}
\li{Get someone with server access to run \code{nix develop; deploy .#catcolab}.}
\li{Commit and push the changes to the repository.}
}

\p{To give a new user access to the secrets:}
\ol{
\li{Update the public keys in \code{infrastructure/secrets/secrets.nix}. Remember to update the permissions for each file as well.}
\li{Get someone with secret access to run \code{nix develop} in the \code{infrastructure} folder.}
\li{In the resulting Nix shell, run \code{agenix -r} in the \code{infrastructure/secrets} folder.}
\li{Commit and push the changes to the repository.}
}

\p{If you are creating an AWS instance and setting up a CatColab backend, e.g. \code{backend-next}, for the first time:}
\ol{
\li{Create an instance on AWS:}
  \ul{
  \li{Use a community AMI of the form \code{nixos/24.05.????.????????????-x86_64-linux}.}
  \li{Instance type is \code{t3.medium}.}
  \li{Select "Allow HTTPS traffic.." and "Allow HTTP traffic.." in addition to the already selected "Allow SSH traffic from Anywhere".}
  \li{Add 50GB of storage to the instance.}
  }
\li{On the \code{namecheap} domain name hosting service, point \code{backend-next.catcolab.org} to the instance IP address.}
\li{Add a public key of the instance to \code{infrastructure/secrets/secrets.nix}. You can get the public keys by running \code{ssh-keyscan <machine-ip-address>}. Follow the instructions above on giving a new user access to the secrets.}
\li{Add the instance hostname to the desired host under \code{deploy.nodes} in \code{infrastructure/flake.nix}.}
\li{In \code{infrastructure/}, run \code{nix develop} followed by \code{deploy .#catcolab-next}. The systemd \code{automerge} and \code{backend} services will fail at the end of the deployment, because the CatColab repo is missing. We will restart the services later after cloning the repo.}
\li{Access the instance in a new terminal:}
  \ul{
  \li{Log in via \code{ssh root@<instance IP address>}. If you don't have access, ask Evan.}
  \li{On the instance, run \code{init-catcolab.sh <branch-name>}. If the CatColab github repo branch name is omitted, it will clone the \code{main} branch. This script installs the nodejs dependencies, initializes the postgres database, runs the database migrations, and builds the required binaries. The automerge and backend services should run now.}
  }
\li{If you ever need to reset an instance to its original launch state when it was first created, you can do it through the online console, select the instance and choose "Actions > Monitor and Troubleshoot > Replace root volume". Make sure that you choose an AMI of the form \code{nixos/24.05.????.????????????-x86_64-linux} as the launch state, and that you select the box for deleting the old volume when the new volume is created.}
}

\p{Setting up the Postgres database locally:}
\ol{
\li{Assumptions: There is a \code{postgres} user on the machine. The cluster does not contain a \code{catcolab} user or a \code{catcolab} database. Rust and \code{cargo} are installed.}
\li{Get the \code{DATABASE_URL} from the decrypted \code{.env.age} file.}
  \ul{
  \li{In \code{infrastructure/secrets/}, run \code{nix develop} followed by \code{EDITOR=vim agenix -e .env.age}. You should change the \code{EDITOR} variable to your preferred editor tool.}
  }
\li{In \code{infrastructure/scripts}, run \code{su -m postgres -- ./initdb.sh "<DATABASE_URL>"}.}
\li{Run migrations on the database:}
  \ul{
  \li{Install \code{sqlx-cli} with \code{cargo install sqlx-cli}}
  \li{In \code{packages/backend/}, run \code{~/.cargo/bin/sqlx migrate run}}
  }
}

\p{Other TODOs:}
\ol{
\li{Create function that takes a port and outputs nginx}
\li{write up pull and build instructions, scripts and what they do in the repo.}
\li{rebase on main}
\li{test on server}
}
