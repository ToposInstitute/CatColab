\title{Network over a double theory}
\taxon{definition}
\import{macros}

\p{Let #{\dbl{T}} be a simple or cartesian double theory. A \define{network over
\dbl{T}}, or \define{\dbl{T}-network}, is a morphism of (cartesian) double
graphs

##{N: U(\dbl{T}) \to \Span,}

where #{U} is the forgetful 2-functor and, by a harmless abuse of notation,
\Span also denotes the (cartesian) double graph of spans.
