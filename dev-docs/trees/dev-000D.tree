\title{Refs}

\p{A "ref" is a persistent reference to a document. A running CatColab server
maintains an in-memory hash map from refs to Automerge documents; there can be
at most one Automerge document that is "controlling" a ref at a given time.}

\p{Refs are identified by UUIDs. In the future, they will also have editable
metadata such as taxon, title, author(s), tags, and so on.}

\p{Additionally, a ref has a \code{head} field that points to a particular
[snapshot](dev-000C) for the ref. The "autosave" mechanism updates the content
of this snapshot every time the Automerge document connected to the ref is
mutated. "Saving" a ref just means creating a new snapshot and making it the
head. The previous head will continue to exist as a snapshot, and can be used to
revert the ref to its state at a previous point in time.}
