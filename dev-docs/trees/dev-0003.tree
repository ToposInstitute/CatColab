\title{Language}

\p{The obvious choice is \strong{[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)}.
It is a saner JavaScript and the new industry standard.}

\p{OCaml, [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/), and Scala stand out as modern
statically typed programming languages with reasonable stories about compiling to
JavaScript, but will have less refined ecosystems and toolchains.
[Hazel](https://hazel.org/), a toy structure editor for a functional programming
language, is written in OCaml ([GitHub](https://github.com/hazelgrove/hazel)).
Since we do not aim to innovate in frontend programming, we should stick to the
mainstream, hence JavaScript/TypeScript.}

\title{UI framework}

\p{The proliferation of web
[UI frameworks](https://bestofjs.org/projects?tags=framework) is notorious.
\strong{React} remains the industry standard and would be a safe choice,
although in past experience it felt a bit clunky and boilerplate-y.}

\p{\strong{[Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/)} is an appealing newer framework
that is clearly inspired by React but has learned some lessons
([HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30508524)). It ditches the virtual
DOM and has a better story about component updates ("reactivity"), being one
of few frameworks to have proper support for
[nested reactivity](https://www.solidjs.com/tutorial/stores_nested_reactivity).}
