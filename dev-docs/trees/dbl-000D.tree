\title{Free models of double theories}
\import{macros}

\p{The free models of a double theory are often singled out in applications. For
example, free [signed categories](dct-0002) can be interpreted as causal loop
diagrams or regulatory networks, depending on the application. Here we look for
a general definition of a free model of an arbitrary double theory. Any such
definition should recover the familiar free-forgetful adjunction between graphs
and categories when specialized to the [trivial double theory](thy-0001).}
