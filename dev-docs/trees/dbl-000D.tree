\title{Free models of double theories}
\import{macros}

\p{The \em{free} models of a double theory are often singled out in
applications. For example, free [signed categories](dct-0002) can be interpreted
as causal loop diagrams or regulatory networks, depending on the application.
Here we seek a definition of a free model of an arbitrary double theory. We will
recover the familiar free-forgetful adjunction between graphs and categories
when the theory is specialized to the [trivial double theory](thy-0001).}

\p{Our strategy is to use a forgetful 2-functor from double categories to
"double graphs," as defined below. I (Evan) don't have a reference for the
following but I've used it before in my unpublished notes on pull-push
formalism.}

\p{More generally, we define:}

\transclude{dbl-000F}

\p{Taking the 2-category #{\twocat{K} = \Cat} in this definition, we obtain a
2-category of double graphs, call it \twocat{DblGph}. For any choice of maps
between double categories, there is a 2-functor

##{U: \twocat{Dbl} \to \twocat{DblGph}}

that forgets the external composition and identities in a double category
(pseudocategory in \Cat). When applied to pseudo, lax, or colax double functors,
it also forgets the composition and identity comparisons. Crucially, these
comparisons are what make models of double theories (span-valued lax double
functors) into categorical structures, i.e., structures with composition and
identities.}

\p{All of this extends to cartesian double categories and "cartesian double
graphs," as defined below.}

\transclude{dbl-000G}

\p{There is a 2-category of cartesian double graphs, cartesian morphisms between
them, and cells between those (with no extra conditions). As before, for any
choice morphisms between cartesian double categories, we obtain a forgetful
2-functor

##{U: \twocat{CartDbl} \to \twocat{CartDblGph}.}

}

\p{The data that generates a free model we will provisionally call a "network"
since it will encompass familiar concepts such as graphs and Petri nets.}

\title{Examples of networks over double theories}
\taxon{example}

\ul{
\li{A network over the [trivial double theory](thy-0001) is a graph}

\li{A network over the [theory of signed categories](thy-0002) is a
\define{signed graph}: a graph with each edge weighted by a plus or minus sign.}

\li{A network over the theory of commutative monoids, such that the monoids of
objects and of arrows are both free, is a \define{Petri net}: a pair of sets
#{S} and #{T} together with a pair of maps #{T \rightrightarrows \N[S]}, where
#{\N[S]} is the free commutative monoid on #{S} (see, for example, [Baez and
Pollard 2017](baez-pollard-2017)).}}
