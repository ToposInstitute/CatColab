\title{Free models of double theories}
\import{macros}

\p{The free models of a double theory are often singled out in applications. For
example, free [signed categories](dct-0002) can be interpreted as causal loop
diagrams or regulatory networks, depending on the application. Here we seek a
definition of a free model of an arbitrary double theory. The definition will
recover the familiar free-forgetful adjunction between graphs and categories
when specialized to the [trivial double theory](thy-0001).}

\p{Our strategy is to use a forgetful 2-functor from double categories to
"double graphs," as defined below. I don't have a reference for the following
but I've used it before in my unpublished notes on pull-push formalism.}

\transclude{dbl-000E}

\p{More generally, we define:}

\transclude{dbl-000F}

\p{Taking the 2-category #{\twocat{K} = \Cat} in this definition, we obtain a
2-category of double graphs, call it \twocat{DblGph}. For any choice of maps
between double categories, there is a 2-functor

##{U: \twocat{Dbl} \to \twocat{DblGph}}

that forgets the external composition and identities in a double category
(pseudocategory in \Cat). When applied to pseudo, lax, or colax double functors,
it also forgets the composition and identity comparisons. Crucially, these
comparisons are what make models of double theories (span-valued lax double
functors) into categorical structures, i.e., structures with composition and
identities.}

\p{All of this extends to cartesian double categories and "cartesian double
graphs," as defined below.}

\transclude{dbl-000G}

\p{There is a 2-category of cartesian double graphs, cartesian morphisms between
them, and cells between those (with no extra conditions). As before, for any
choice morphisms between cartesian double categories, we obtain a forgetful
2-functor

##{U: \twocat{CartDbl} \to \twocat{CartDblGph}.}
