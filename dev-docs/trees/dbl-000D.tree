\title{Free models of double theories}
\import{macros}

\p{The free models of a double theory are often singled out in applications. For
example, free [signed categories](dct-0002) can be interpreted as causal loop
diagrams or regulatory networks, depending on the application. Here we seek a
definition of a free model of an arbitrary double theory. Any such definition
should recover the familiar free-forgetful adjunction between graphs and
categories when specialized to the [trivial double theory](thy-0001).}

\p{Our strategy is to use a forgetful 2-functor from double categories to
"double graphs," as defined below. I don't have a reference for the following
but I've used it in my unpublished notes on pull-push formalism.}

\transclude{dbl-000E}

\p{There is a 2-category of double graphs, starting with the 2-category
#{\twocat{K} = \Cat} in the following definition.}

\transclude{dbl-000F}

\p{For any choice of maps between double categories, there is a 2-functor

##{U: \twocat{Dbl} \to \twocat{DblGph}}

that forgets the external composition and identities in a double category (a
pseudocategory in \Cat). When applied to pseudo, lax, or colax double functors,
it also forgets the composition and identity comparisons. Crucially, these
comparisons are what make models of double theories (span-valued lax double
functors) into structures with composition and identities.}
