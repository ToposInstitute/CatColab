\title{Symbols}
\import{macros}

\p{Julia has a built-in \code{Symbol} type, which is a kind of
\wikipedia{interned string}. Rust has no built-in data type for symbols but has
a wide variety of external packages providing such functionalityâ€”a variety that
is both a blessing and a curse. In fact, there are two strategies to create a
data structure for \em{symbols}, an informal term for immutable, cheaply
cloneable strings: interned strings and small strings.}

\subtree{
\title{Interned strings}

\p{There are numerous Rust packages for [string
interning](https://lib.rs/search?q=interning). Some of the most popular are:
\ul{
\li{[string_cache](https://lib.rs/crates/string_cache)}
\li{[string-interner](https://lib.rs/crates/string-interner)}
\li{[internment](https://lib.rs/crates/internment)}
\li{[ustr](https://lib.rs/crates/ustr)}
}
}

\p{Compared to the alternatives, the package \code{internment} is notable for
(1) interning arbitrary data, not just strings and (2) supporting several
strategies for when, if ever, to free the interned data.}

\subtree{
\title{Small strings}

\p{Small strings are an application of the "small vector optimization" to
strings, which are vectors of characters. There are again many packages
providing strings that are stack-allocated up to a certain size. The most
popular seems to be [smol_str](https://lib.rs/crates/smol_str), the README of
which states that "the primary use case for \code{SmolStr} is a good enough
default storage for tokens of typical programming languages." Here is a
[survey](https://github.com/rosetta-rs/string-rosetta-rs) of string types in
Rust; another comparison is in the README of
[hipstr](https://github.com/polazarus/hipstr?tab=readme-ov-file#-similar-crates).}
