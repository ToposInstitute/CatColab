CatColab is a collaborative environment for *formal, interoperable, conceptual modeling*.

Elaborating on these keywords, CatColab aims to be:

- **Formal**: Models created in the system, be they qualitative or quantitative,
  are well-defined mathematical objects that can be critiqued with clarity.
- **Interoperable**: Models, and the logics in which they are expressed, can be
  flexibly interoperated with each other, without privileging any viewpoint as
  primary.
- **Conceptual**: Each domain-specific logic in the system is well adapted to
  the concepts used by practitioners in that domain.
- **Modeling**: Constructing a model is a collaborative, ongoing process that
  does not required participants to have specialized technical expertise.


## Versions

There are two versions of CatColab available to use:

- The **production version**: [catcolab.org](https://catcolab.org).
  This tracks the latest [release](https://github.com/ToposInstitute/CatColab/releases), so it is the most stable version.
- The **development version**: [next.catcolab.org](https://next.catcolab.org).
  This tracks the `main` branch of this repository, so it contains all the newest experimental features but is therefore more likely to have bugs.

Each of our major releases is accompanied by a blog post:

- [v0.1: Hummingbird](https://topos.institute/blog/2024-10-02-introducing-catcolab/)
- [v0.2: Wren](https://topos.institute/blog/2025-02-05-catcolab-0-2-wren/)
