# CatColab

CatColab (working name) is a collaborative environment for *formal,
interoperable, conceptual modeling*.

Elaborating on these keywords, CatColab aims to be:

- **Formal**: Models created in the system, be they qualitative or quantitative,
  are well-defined mathematical objects that can be critiqued with clarity.
- **Interoperable**: Models, and the logics in which they are expressed, can be
  flexibly interoperated with each other, without privileging any viewpoint as
  primary.
- **Conceptual**: Each domain-specific logic in the system is well adapted to
  the concepts used by practitioners in that domain.
- **Modeling**: Constructing a model is a collaborative, ongoing process that
  does not required participants to have specialized technical expertise.

## For users

The production deployment, tracking the latest
[release](https://github.com/ToposInstitute/CatColab/releases), is available at
<https://catcolab.org>. For more about the project and where it's going, see the
[help page](https://catcolab.org/help) and our blog posts about the releases so
far:

- [v0.1: Hummingbird](https://topos.site/blog/2024-10-02-introducing-catcolab/)
- [v0.2: Wren](https://topos.institute/blog/2025-02-05-catcolab-0-2-wren/)

## For developers

The staging deployment, synced to the `main` branch, is available at
<https://next.catcolab.org>. Documentation for developers is browsable at
<https://next.catcolab.org/dev/>.

CatColab is written in a mix of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). To start developing, install Rust
(say by using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)) and install
[pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), or use the [dev container](./.devcontainer/).

### Frontend development

To develop the frontend locally, clone the repository and run

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run build
pnpm run dev --mode staging
```

Then navigate your browser to the URL provided by Vite. Note that the flag
`--mode staging` uses the staging deployment of the backend. For other options,
see the [frontend README](packages/frontend/).

### Backend development

Developing the backend locally requires more setup. See the instructions in the
[backend README](packages/backend/).

### Formatting and linting

To maintain a clean and consistent codebase, we follow strict conventions on
code formatting and style. To format and lint the frontend code, run these
commands:

```sh
cd packages/frontend
pnpm run format
pnpm run lint
```

To format and lint the Rust code, run these commands:

```sh
cargo fmt
cargo clippy
```

Try to remember to run these commands before making a PR. (If you forget, the CI
will remind you.)

## For mathematicians

As the name suggests, CatColab is based on mathematical ideas from category
theory. It is a specific design goal that the system be usable *without* any
knowledge of such ideas. Still, for those curious about the underlying
mathematics, here are a few pointers for further reading.

CatColab is an editor for categorical structures and their morphisms and higher
morphisms. The meta-logical framework organizing these categorical structures is
based on [double category theory](https://mathoverflow.net/q/476936). More
precisely, the **domain-specific logics** in CatColab are defined by [double
theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05384), and the **models** in CatColab are
models of double theories.

The library of domain-specific logics in CatColab, available now and to grow
over time, is inspired by a wide body of research in applied category theory and
beyond. Incomplete bibliographies are in the [dev
docs](https://next.catcolab.org/dev/bib-0001.xml) and the [core
docs](https://next.catcolab.org/dev/rust/catlog/refs/).
