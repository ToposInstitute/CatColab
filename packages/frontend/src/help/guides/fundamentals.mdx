In many places, we describe CatColab as a ...

> collaborative environment for formal, interoperable, conceptual modeling.

But what do we actually mean by this?
This guide aims to answer that question on (at least) two levels: firstly, breaking down this description word by word, examining what we mean by each one and how we have come to our understanding of its use; and secondly, what this means in actual concrete terms, and *what CatColab actually does* and *how you can use it*.

Before diving into details, it might be helpful to describe some user stories:
**first, some example use cases**

- **epidemiologists**
- **data scientist (acsets for exploring possible structures of data)**
- **public policy makers (CLDs)**
- **educator teaching about ODEs that describe systems**
- **researcher prototyping different semantics (but don't use that word) on the same model**



























## Explaining our terminology

- **... probably take some stuff from the old concepts.mdx file?**

{/*## Concepts

While CatColab has a notebook-style interface inspired by computational
notebooks like JupyterLab and structured document editors like Notion, its
conceptual underpinnings are quite different from both kinds of tools. Here is
an overview of the concepts that you'll encounter in CatColab today.

<dl>

<dt>Logic</dt>

<dd>CatColab is not a general-purpose programming or modeling language but is
rather an extensible environment for working in *domain-specific logics*, such
as those of database schemas or biochemical regulatory networks. To do anything
in the tool besides write text, you'll need to <A href="theories">choose a
logic</A>.</dd>

<dt>Model</dt>

<dd>Models in CatColab are models *within* a logic, such as a particular
database schema or regulatory network. Models are specified declaratively and
are well-defined mathematical objects. CatColab is a structure editor for models
in a logic, allowing formal declarations to be intermixed with descriptive rich
text.</dd>

<dt>Analysis</dt>

<dd>Unlike most computational notebooks, CatColab strictly separates the
*specification* of a model from any outputs derived from it. Depending on the
logic, an analysis of a model might include visualization, simulation,
identification of motifs, and translation into other formats.</dd>

</dl>

Future of versions of CatColab will display the further concepts of
**instances**, **morphisms**, and **migrations**, to be described when they
become available.*/}

### Collaborative

> *Models can be built by multiple people working either synchronously or asynchronously, and either in-person or remotely*

- **whiteboards/pen and paper/sticky notes**
- **live simultaneous editing**
- **asynchronous editing**
- **permissions setting**













### Formal

> *Models are mathematical objects that can be critiqued with clarity*

- **diagrams are great**
- **a concrete thing that lets two people point at it and know that they are pointing at the same thing (but obviously whether or not they understand it in the same way is a social question)**
- **allow for technological support with things that computers are actually really good at doing (think interacting with an LSP and the kinds of tasks this can help with)**













### Interoperable

> *Models, and different modeling languages, can "plug in" to one another*

- **don't want to make one big language to rule them all, but lots of translatable DSLs**
- **no vendor lock-in**











### Conceptual

> *Modelling languages are well adapted to concepts used by practitioners*
