# Quick introduction

Here are a few models created for a quick introduction to CatColab. 

To visualize any of these models, open the menu in the upper-left
of their page, click "new analysis", click the + symbol on the new pane that appears, and select "Visualization."

These models are view-only, which means that while you can edit them, your edits will not be saved. If you duplicate
the model in the same menu, you'll get a copy you (if you're logged in) own and can edit, save, and re-permission as you like.
