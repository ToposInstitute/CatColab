## Description

A model relative to the empty logic is called **informal** because it contains
no formal content, only the rich text allowed in any model notebook.

When you create a new model in CatColab, it will by default belong to this
logic. You can start typing right away, but to add any structured content,
you'll need to migrate to a nontrivial logic. <A href="/help/theories">Read more
