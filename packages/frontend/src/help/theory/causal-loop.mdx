## Description

A causal loop diagram is a fundamental gadget in systems dynamics, 
representing a system of causally interacting variables. Variables
can encourage or discourage each other according to positively, 
respectively, negatively signed edges. 

It's important in systems dynamics research to find feedback loops in 
causal loop diagrams. Positive feedback loops tend to produce unstable behavior,
while negative feedback loops are stabilizing. CatColab supports this analysis 
by searching for morphisms from the causal loop diagram given by a free loop. 
This is the first demonstration in the tool of the general principle that edges in 
CatColab models can actually be composed as in a category, rather than forming 
a mere graph.

Causal loop diagrams do not currently support instances, though we'd be
curious to learn more about how they might be used in practice.


## Analyses


### Lotka--Volterra

#### Semantics

An arrow $A\xrightarrow{\pm}B$ is interpreted as the equation $\dot{B}=\pm (kA + g)B$ for some constants $k$ (the *interaction coefficient*) and $g$ (the *growth rate*).
Multiple incoming arrows are interpreted additively, so e.g. $A\xrightarrow{+}B\xleftarrow{-}C$ is interpreted as $\dot{B}=(kA - \ell C + g)B$.

#### User inputs

- **Initial value.**
  ($\mathbb{R}_{\geqslant0}$)
  The initial value of the variable.
- **Interaction.**
  ($\mathbb{R}_{\geqslant0}$)
  The interaction coefficient ($k$) corresponding to the arrow.
- **Growth/decay.**
  ($\mathbb{R}$)
  The growth rate of the variable.
- **Duration.**
  ($\mathbb{R}_{\geqslant0}$)
  The total duration of the simulation in units of time.


### Linear ODE

#### Semantics

An arrow $A\xrightarrow{\pm}B$ is interpreted as the equation $\dot{B}=\pm k A$ for some constant $k$.
Multiple incoming arrows are interpreted additively, so e.g. $A\xrightarrow{+}B\xleftarrow{-}C$ is interpreted as $\dot{B}=kA-\ell B$.

#### User inputs

- **Initial value.**
  ($\mathbb{R}_{\geqslant0}$)
  The initial value of the variable.
- **Coefficient.**
  ($\mathbb{R}_{\geqslant0}$)
  The coefficient ($k$) corresponding to the arrow.
- **Duration.**
  ($\mathbb{R}_{\geqslant0}$)
  The total duration of the simulation in units of time.
