## Description

Causal loop diagrams with delays allow for pauses or caesuras in the flow of causality.
We expect to implement a delay differential equation-based semantics, but one
appears not to be standard in the literature. For more, see <A

John Baez has a series of blog posts on building variants of the causal loop diagram
theory with an arbitrary monoid of *polarities* on the edges, starting [here](https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2024/11/02/polarities/).
