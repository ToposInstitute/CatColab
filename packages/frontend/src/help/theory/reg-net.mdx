## Description

Regulatory networks depict promoting or inhibiting interactions between molecules in a biochemical system.
CatColab's theory for regulatory networks presents *signed categories*, where the objects are molecules and the morphisms are interactions between molecules. The interactions are labeled with a sign, which indicates whether the interaction is promoting or inhibiting. It may be interesting to note that 
this theory is isomorphic to that of <A
href="../causal-loop">causal loop diagram,</A>  even though the two are presented in different ways in the system.

Instances of regulatory networks are not currently supported,
because we don't understand what they mean, biologically. If you have any thoughts,
we'd love to hear them.

Regulatory networks support an ODE semantics based on the Lotka-Volterra equations, where 
the derivative of each species is the sum of a linear term proportional to its own value 
and quadratic terms proportional to the product of its own value and that of the species on the
other end of an interaction.

## Examples

The classic Lotka-Volterra [model](https://catcolab.org/analysis/0194d42c-6e20-72f1-85c3-21c97724b047) of foxes and rabbits, together with an ODE semantics.
