import { A } from "@solidjs/router";

## Description

An extension of <A href="../causal-loop">causal loop diagrams</A> (CLDs) where we include the additional information of *differential degree* and *delay degree*. In terms of implementation, this corresponds to labelling each arrow with a sign (as in a CLD) and two natural numbers: one for the differential degree ("one variable affects the *n-th derivative* of another variable") and one for the delay degree ("one variable affects another variable with a *delay governed by an n-th order Erlang distribution*").
