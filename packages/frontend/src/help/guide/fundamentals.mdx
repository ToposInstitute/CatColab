In many places, we describe CatColab as a ...

> collaborative environment for formal, interoperable, conceptual modeling.

But what do we actually mean by this?
This guide aims to answer that question on (at least) two levels: firstly, breaking down this description word by word, examining what we mean by each one and how we have come to our understanding of its use; and secondly, what this means in actual concrete terms, and *what the software actually does* and *how you can use it*.

In brief, we use the following definitions:

<dl>
  <dt>collaborative</dt>
  <dd>models can be built by multiple people working either synchronously or asynchronously, and either in-person or remotely</dd>
  <dt>formal</dt>
  <dd>models are mathematical objects that can be critiqued with clarity</dd>
  <dt>interoperable</dt>
  <dd>models, and modeling languages, can be interoperated with each other</dd>
  <dt>conceptual</dt>
  <dd>modeling languages are well adapted to concepts used by practitioners</dd>
</dl>
