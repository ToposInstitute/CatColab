Here are a few models created for a quick introduction to CatColab.
To visualize any of these, open the main menu in the upper-left of their page, click "new analysis", click the + symbol on the new pane that appears, and select "Visualization."

These models are view-only, which means that you can edit them but your edits will not be saved.
If you duplicate the model (from the main menu in the upper-left), you'll get a copy that you (if you're logged in) own, and can edit, save, and re-permission as you like.
