## Research

CatColab is not only a technology. It's also an ongoing research project,
drawing on research in mathematics and computer science conducted at Topos
Institute, by our collaborators, in the (applied) category theory community, and
beyond. An incomplete <A href="/dev/bib-0001.xml">bibliography</A> is available
in the developer docs.
