# Logics

Every model in CatColab is relative to a **logic**. The logic defines what kinds
of objects and arrows you can specify in the model. A logic also comes with a
set of built-in analyses that can be performed on its models.

Here is the list of logics currently supported by CatColab, grouped by the
domain to which each logic applies.
