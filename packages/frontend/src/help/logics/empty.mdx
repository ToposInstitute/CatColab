import { A } from "@solidjs/router";

## Description

A model relative to the empty logic is called **informal** because it contains no formal content, only the rich text allowed in any model notebook.

When you create a new model in CatColab, it will by default belong to this logic.
You can start typing right away, but to add any *structured* content, you'll need to switch to a different, non-trivial, logic.
