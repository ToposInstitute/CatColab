## Description

The unary discrete exterior calculus (DEC) is an implementation of the unary part of the *discrete exterior calculus*, an approach to discrete differential geometry due initially to Anil Hirani.
The Topos Institute and collaborators have a substantial DEC library called [Decapodes](https://algebraicjulia.github.io/Decapodes.jl/dev/) implemented in the AlgebraicJulia project.
The main purpose of the DEC logic in CatColab is to permit the user to build a PDE system via a structure editor which can then be solved in Decapodes, with the result animated right inside of CatColab.

<Warning>
This workflow has been completed in some proofs of concept, but the need to run a Julia kernel means it's not particularly convenient for non-Julia users at this time.
Instructions on the process to do so for those who like are available [on GitHub](https://github.com/ToposInstitute/CatColab/tree/main/packages/algjulia-service).
