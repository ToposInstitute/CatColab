## Description

An **ontology log**, or **olog** for short, is a semi-formal representation of
knowledge or a viewpoint.
Ologs are expressed in a diagrammatic language based on boxes, known as **types**, and arrows, known as **aspects** of types.
An olog is *semi*-formal because, while its types and aspects are formal structure, convention says that these should be labeled with natural text such that an arrow can be read from left to right as a grammatical sentence.

Ologs are a simple language that is easy to get started with. An olog can be
used as a stepping stone toward a more precise model, such as a <A
