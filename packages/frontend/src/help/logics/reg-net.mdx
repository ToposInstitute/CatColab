## Description

Regulatory networks depict promoting or inhibiting interactions between molecules in a biochemical system, called **species**.
The interactions are either **promoting** ($A\to B$) or **inhibiting** ($A\dashv B$).

This theory is technically isomorphic to that of <A href="../causal-loop">causal loop diagrams</A>, even though the two are presented in different ways.


### Examples

- The classic Lotka-Volterra [model](https://catcolab.org/model/0196b22f-b9b3-7841-a841-54fbc192148b) of foxes and rabbits, together with an ODE semantics.

## Instances and analyses

### Instances

<Question>
Regulatory networks do not currently support instances because we don't understand what they might mean, biologically.
If you have any thoughts on how they might be used in practice then please do get in touch.

### Analyses

<HelpAnalysisById theory={props.theory} analysisId="diagram"/>

<HelpAnalysisById theory={props.theory} analysisId="negative-loops">
Negative feedback loops are composites of paths within the diagram that start and finish at the same point, and whose overall sign (given by multiplying all the signs of each constituent path) is positive.
Negative feedback loops tend to be stabilising.

<HelpAnalysisById theory={props.theory} analysisId="positive-loops">
Positive feedback loops are composites of paths within the diagram that start and finish at the same point, and whose overall sign (given by multiplying all the signs of each constituent path) is positive.
Positive feedback loops tend to produce unstable behavior.

<HelpAnalysisById theory={props.theory} analysisId="linear-ode">
A promotion $A\to B$ is interpreted as the equation $\dot{B}=k A$ for some non-negative constant $k$; an inhibition $A\dashv B$ is interpreted as $\dot{B}=-k A$.
Multiple incoming arrows are interpreted additively, so e.g. $A\to B\vdash C$ is interpreted as $\dot{B}=kA-\ell C$.
</HelpAnalysisById>

<HelpAnalysisById theory={props.theory} analysisId="lotka-volterra">
A promotion $A\to B$ is interpreted as the equation $\dot{B}=(kA+g)B$ for some non-negative constant $k$ (the *interaction coefficient*) and constant $g$ (the *growth rate*); an inhibition $A\dashv B$ is interpreted as $\dot{B}=-(kA+g)B$.
Multiple incoming arrows are interpreted additively, so e.g. $A\to B\vdash C$ is interpreted as $\dot{B}=(kA - \ell C + g)B$.
