## Description

Stock and flow (or simply *stock-flow*) diagrams are fundamental to systems dynamics.
They provide a rich language, allowing the scientist to model a system of stocks of various quantities and flows between them, with the rate of the flows depending in complex ways on various stocks via *links*.

<Warning>
In CatColab we implement what we call *primitive* stock-flow diagrams, which do not allow for the auxiliary variables permitting flows to be arbitrary functions of the stocks, which is characteristic in systems dynamics.
We expect to implement this richer semantics in the future.

## Instances

<Question>
Instances are not currently supported for stock-flow diagrams, but if you have suggestions for what these might mean to a systems theorist then please do reach out and let us know.

## Analyses

**!TO-DO: include!**

Primitive stock-flow diagrams already admit an interesting ODE semantics based on mass action kinetics.
