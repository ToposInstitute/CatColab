## Description

A **causal loop diagram** is a fundamental gadget in systems dynamics, representing a system of causally interacting variables.
Variables can "encourage" or "discourage" each other, determined by the sign (positive of negative, respectively) of the arrow between them.

## Instances and analyses

### Analyses

<HelpAnalysisById theory={props.theory} analysisId="diagram"/>

<HelpAnalysisById theory={props.theory} analysisId="negative-loops">
Balancing loops are composites of paths within the diagram that start and finish at the same point, and whose overall sign (given by multiplying all the signs of each constituent path) is positive.
Balancing loops tend to be stabilising.
</HelpAnalysisById>

<HelpAnalysisById theory={props.theory} analysisId="positive-loops">
Reinforcing loops are composites of paths within the diagram that start and finish at the same point, and whose overall sign (given by multiplying all the signs of each constituent path) is positive.
Reinforcing loops tend to produce unstable behavior.

<HelpAnalysisById theory={props.theory} analysisId="linear-ode">
An arrow $A\xrightarrow{\pm}B$ is interpreted as the equation $\dot{B}=\pm k A$ for some non-negative constant $k$.
Multiple incoming arrows are interpreted additively, so e.g. $A\xrightarrow{+}B\xleftarrow{-}C$ is interpreted as $\dot{B}=kA-\ell C$.
</HelpAnalysisById>

<HelpAnalysisById theory={props.theory} analysisId="lotka-volterra">
An arrow $A\xrightarrow{\pm}B$ is interpreted as the equation $\dot{B}=\pm (kA + g)B$ for some non-negative constant $k$ (the *interaction coefficient*) and constant $g$ (the *growth rate*).
Multiple incoming arrows are interpreted additively, so e.g. $A\xrightarrow{+}B\xleftarrow{-}C$ is interpreted as $\dot{B}=(kA - \ell C + g)B$.
