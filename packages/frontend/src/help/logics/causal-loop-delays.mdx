## Description

**Causal loop diagrams with delays** allow for delays (or *caesuras*) in the flow of causality, extending the basic notion of <A href="../causal-loop">causal loop diagrams</A>.


### Examples

- [CA Cap-and-trade](https://catcolab.org/model/0194d7b1-2a7d-7be2-a338-b607c61bf0d4), from Tom Fiddaman and Ron Suiter's "[Are causal loop diagrams useful?](https://metasd.com/2010/04/are-causal-loop-diagrams-useful/)"

## Instances and analyses

### Analyses

<HelpAnalysisById theory={props.theory} analysisId="diagram"/>

<HelpAnalysisById theory={props.theory} analysisId="negative-loops">
Balancing loops are composites of paths within the diagram that start and finish at the same point, and whose overall sign (given by multiplying all the signs of each constituent path) is positive.
Balancing loops tend to be stabilising.
</HelpAnalysisById>

<HelpAnalysisById theory={props.theory} analysisId="positive-loops">
Positive feedback loops, or *reinforcing loops*, are composites of paths within the diagram that start and finish at the same point, and whose overall sign (given by multiplying all the signs of each constituent path) is positive.
Reinforcing loops tend to produce unstable behavior.
</HelpAnalysisById>

<HelpAnalysisById theory={props.theory} analysisId="delayed-negative-loops">
A balancing loop is said to be *slow acting*, or *delayed*, if **any** of its constituent paths is marked with a delay.
</HelpAnalysisById>

<HelpAnalysisById theory={props.theory} analysisId="delayed-positive-loops">
A reinforcing loop is said to be *slow acting*, or *delayed*, if **any** of its constituent paths is marked with a delay.
