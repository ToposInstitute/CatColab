## Description

Causal loop diagrams with delays allow for delays (or *caesuras*) in the flow of causality, extending the basic notion of <A href="../causal-loop">causal loop diagrams</A>.


## Instances

<Question>
As with standard causal loop diagrams, instances are not currently supported, though we'd be curious to learn more about how they might be used in practice.
If you have any ideas then please do get in touch.

## Analyses
