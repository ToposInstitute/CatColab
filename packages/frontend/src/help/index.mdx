# Help & resources

## CatColab is...

- a collaborative environment for *formal, interoperable, conceptual modeling*
- an open source software project: [find us on
  GitHub](https://github.com/ToposInstitute/CatColab)
- a technology created by [Topos Institute](https://topos.site/) and our
  partners: <A href="credits">read the credits</A>

<Warning>
CatColab is a pre-alpha software under active development. You are welcome to
experiment but you should not store any important or sensitive data in the
system.
</Warning>

## Concepts

While CatColab has a notebook-style interface that draws inspiration from
computational notebooks like JupyterLab and structured document editors like
Notion and Coda, its conceptual underpinnings are quite different from both of
those classes of tools. Here is an overview of the concepts that you'll
encounter in CatColab today:

<dl>

<dt>Logic</dt>

<dd>CatColab is not a general-purpose programming or modeling language but is
rather an extensible environment for working in *domain-specific logics*, such
as those of database schemas or biochemical regulatory networks. To do anything
in the tool besides write text, you'll need to choose a logic.</dd>

<dt>Model</dt>

<dd>Models in CatColab are models *within* a logic, such as a particular
database schema or regulatory network. Models are specified declaratively and
are well-defined mathematical objects. CatColab is a structure editor for models
in a logic, allowing formal declarations to be intermixed with descriptive rich
text.</dd>

<dt>Analysis</dt>

<dd>Unlike most computational notebooks, CatColab strictly separates the
*specification* of a model from any outputs derived from it. Depending on the
logic, an analysis of a model might include visualization, simulation,
identification of motifs, and translation into other formats.</dd>

</dl>

Future of versions of CatColab will display the further concepts of
**instances**, **morphisms**, and **migrations**, to be described when they
become available.
