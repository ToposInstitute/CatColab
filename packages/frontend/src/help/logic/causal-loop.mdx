## Description

A **causal loop diagram** is a fundamental gadget in systems dynamics, representing a system of causally interacting variables.
Variables can "encourage" or "discourage" each other, determined by the sign (positive of negative, respectively) of the arrow between them.

## Instances and analyses

### Instances

<Question>
Causal loop diagrams do not currently support instances, though we'd be curious to learn more about how they might be used in practice.
If you have any ideas then please do get in touch.

### Analyses

<HelpAnalysisById theory={props.theory} analysisId="diagram"/>

<HelpAnalysisById theory={props.theory} analysisId="negative-loops">
Negative feedback loops, or *balancing loops*, are composites of paths within the diagram that start and finish at the same point, and whose overall sign (given by multiplying all the signs of each constituent path) is positive.
Reinforcing loops tend to be stabilising.
</HelpAnalysisById>

<HelpAnalysisById theory={props.theory} analysisId="positive-loops">
Positive feedback loops, or *reinforcing loops*, are composites of paths within the diagram that start and finish at the same point, and whose overall sign (given by multiplying all the signs of each constituent path) is positive.
Reinforcing loops tend to produce unstable behavior.
