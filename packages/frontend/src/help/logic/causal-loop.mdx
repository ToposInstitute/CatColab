## Description

A causal loop diagram is a fundamental gadget in systems dynamics, representing a system of causally interacting variables. Variables can "encourage" or "discourage" each other according to positively or negatively signed edges (respectively).

It's important in systems dynamics research to find feedback loops in causal loop diagrams. Positive feedback loops tend to produce unstable behavior, while negative feedback loops are stabilizing. CatColab supports this analysis by searching for morphisms from the causal loop diagram given by a free loop. This is the first demonstration in the tool of the general principle that edges in CatColab models can actually be composed as in a category, rather than forming a mere graph.


## Instances

<Question>
Causal loop diagrams do not currently support instances, though we'd be curious to learn more about how they might be used in practice.
If you have any ideas then please do get in touch.

## Analyses

Causal loop diagrams currently support two analyses: **Linear ODE** and **Lotka–Volterra**.

<div class="help-analysis-pane">
### Linear ODE

#### Semantics

Whenever we have *unidirectional* influence between variables, we might want to consider **linear first-order dynamics**, where variables affect the *first derivative* of other variables, with no feedback a priori.
(For systems where variables directly influence *higher-order* derivatives of other variables, see the linear ODE analysis for <A href="../extended-causal-loop">**extended** causal loop diagrams</A>.)

An arrow $A\xrightarrow{\pm}B$ is interpreted as the equation $\dot{B}=\pm k A$ for some constant $k$.
Multiple incoming arrows are interpreted additively, so e.g. $A\xrightarrow{+}B\xleftarrow{-}C$ is interpreted as $\dot{B}=kA-\ell C$.

#### User inputs

<dl>
  <dt>Initial value: $\mathbb{R}_{\geqslant0}$</dt>
  <dd>The initial value of the variable.</dd>
  <dt>Coefficient: $\mathbb{R}_{\geqslant0}$</dt>
  <dd>The coefficient ($k$) corresponding to the arrow.</dd>
  <dt>Duration: $\mathbb{R}_{\geqslant0}$</dt>
  <dd>The total duration of the simulation in units of time.</dd>
</dl>
</div>



<div class="help-analysis-pane">
### Lotka–Volterra

#### Semantics

In contrast to linear dynamics, we might want to think about **Lotka–Volterra dynamics** whenever influence between variables is *bidirectional*, e.g. for predator-prey models, where higher population of predators means lower population of prey means lower population of predators means ... and so on.

An arrow $A\xrightarrow{\pm}B$ is interpreted as the equation $\dot{B}=\pm (kA + g)B$ for some constant $k$ (the *interaction coefficient*) and $g$ (the *growth rate*).
Multiple incoming arrows are interpreted additively, so e.g. $A\xrightarrow{+}B\xleftarrow{-}C$ is interpreted as $\dot{B}=(kA - \ell C + g)B$.

#### User inputs

<dl>
  <dt>Initial value: $\mathbb{R}_{\geqslant0}$</dt>
  <dd>The initial value of the variable.</dd>
  <dt>Interaction: $\mathbb{R}_{\geqslant0}$</dt>
  <dd>The interaction coefficient ($k$) corresponding to the arrow.</dd>
  <dt>Growth/decay: $\mathbb{R}$</dt>
  <dd>The growth rate ($g$) of the variable.</dd>
  <dt>Duration: $\mathbb{R}_{\geqslant0}$</dt>
  <dd>The total duration of the simulation in units of time.</dd>
</dl>
