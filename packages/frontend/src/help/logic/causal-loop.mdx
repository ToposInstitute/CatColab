## Description

A causal loop diagram is a fundamental gadget in systems dynamics, representing a system of causally interacting variables.
Variables can "encourage" or "discourage" each other, determined by the sign (positive of negative, respectively) of the arrow between them.


## Instances

<Question>
Causal loop diagrams do not currently support instances, though we'd be curious to learn more about how they might be used in practice.
If you have any ideas then please do get in touch.

## Analyses

It's important in systems dynamics research to find feedback loops in causal loop diagrams.
Positive feedback loops tend to produce unstable behavior, while negative feedback loops are stabilizing.
CatColab supports this analysis by searching for morphisms from the causal loop diagram given by a free loop.
