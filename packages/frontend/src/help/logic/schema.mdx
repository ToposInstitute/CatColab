## Description

A categorical **database schema**, or **schema** for short, 
is a representation of the structure of a database. Schemas are expressed
in a diagrammatic language based on two kinds of boxes: 

[//]: # (Do we want to reuse the olog names?)

- **Entities**, a type of entity or thing; these correspond to the **tables** in standard database theory.
- **Mapping**, a many-to-one relationship between entities; these correspond to the **foreign keys** in standard database theory.
- **Attribute types**, a type of attribute or property; these correspond to the data types of **columns** in standard database theory.
- **Attributes**, a many-to-one relationship between entities and attribute types; these correspond to the **columns** in standard database theory.
- **Operations** on attribute types are many-to-one relationships between attribute types; these represent data operations such as rounding a real number to an integer. Note that this logic supports only single-input operations, so many familiar examples such as sums and averages are not directly representable.

Note also that consistency constraints on the schema are not yet supported, 
though they can be added informally in rich text cells. 

**Instances** of schemas are called **acsets** in applied category theory lingo, 
but can also be thought of as being precisely databases.
