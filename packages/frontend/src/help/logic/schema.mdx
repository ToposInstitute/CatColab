## Description

A categorical **database schema**, or **schema** for short, is a representation of the structure of a database.
Schemas are expressed in a diagrammatic language based on two kinds of boxes:

- **Entities**, corresponding to **tables** in standard database theory
- **Attribute types**, corresponding to **columns**.

Between these boxes there are three types of arrows:

- **Mappings**, many-to-one between entities, corresponding to **foreign keys**
- **Attributes**, many-to-one from entities to attribute types, also corresponding to **columns**
- **Operations**, many-to-one between attribute types, corresponding to data operations (such as rounding a real number to an integer).

**!TO-DO: explain the difference (in terms of columns) between attribute types and attributes!**

<Warning>
  CatColab currently only supports **single-input** operations, so many familiar examples (such as sums and averages) are not directly representable.

  Note that consistency constraints on the scheme are also not yet supported, though they can be added informally in rich text cells.
</Warning>


## Instances

Graphical instances of schemas are called **acsets** in applied category theory lingo, but can also be thought of as being precisely *databases*.


## Analyses

**!TO-DO: include!**
