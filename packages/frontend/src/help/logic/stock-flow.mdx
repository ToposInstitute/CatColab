## Description

Stock-flow diagrams are the crown jewel of systems dynamics, a rich language
allowing the scientist to model a system of stocks of various quantities and
flows between them, with the rate of the flows depending in complex ways on
various stocks via *links*.

In CatColab, we implement what we call *primitive* stock-flow diagrams, which do
not allow for the auxiliary variables permitting flows to be arbitrary functions
of the stocks that are characteristic in systems dynamics. We expect to
implement this richer semantics in the future; meanwhile, primitive stock-flow
diagrams already admit an interesting ODE semantics based on mass action
kinetics.
