## Description

**Stock and flow** (or simply **stock-flow**) diagrams are fundamental to systems dynamics.
They provide a rich language, allowing the scientist to model a system of **stocks** of various quantities and flows between them, with the rate of the flows depending in complex ways on various stocks via **links**.

<Warning>
In CatColab we implement what we call **primitive** stock-flow diagrams, which do not allow for the auxiliary variables permitting flows to be arbitrary functions of the stocks, which is characteristic in systems dynamics.
We expect to implement the richer semantics in the future.
