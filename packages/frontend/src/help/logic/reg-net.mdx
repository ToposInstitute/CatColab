## Description

Regulatory networks depict promoting or inhibiting interactions between molecules in a biochemical system.
CatColab's theory for regulatory networks presents *signed categories*, where the objects are molecules and the morphisms are interactions between molecules.
The interactions are labeled with a sign, which indicates whether the interaction is *promoting* or *inhibiting*.

This theory is technically isomorphic to that of <A href="../causal-loop">causal loop diagrams</A>, even though the two are presented in different ways.


### Examples

- The classic Lotka-Volterra [model](https://catcolab.org/model/0196b22f-b9b3-7841-a841-54fbc192148b) of foxes and rabbits, together with an ODE semantics.

## Instances and analyses

### Instances

<Question>
Regulatory networks do not currently support instances because we don't understand what they might mean, biologically.
If you have any thoughts on how they might be used in practice then please do get in touch.
</Question>


### Analyses

**!TO-DO: include!**

Regulatory networks support an ODE semantics based on the Lotka-Volterra equations, where the derivative of each species is the sum of a linear term proportional to its own value  and quadratic terms proportional to the product of its own value and that of the species on the other end of an interaction.
