# CatColab document sync server

This package provides the [Automerge](https://automerge.org/) document sync
server for CatColab, written in TypeScript as a thin wrapper around
[`automerge-repo`](https://github.com/automerge/automerge-repo).

It is not very useful on its own and is intended to run in conjunction with the
CatColab [backend](../backend/). See there for more information.


## So you think you could get rid of this package, eh?

### Why we need a separate server for hosting automerge

tl;dr: there is, in practice, no automerge server for rust


At first glance, hosting Automerge on a separate server seems like unnecessary complexity. Since
Automerge is written in Rust and we already have a Rust server, why not simply integrate it there?
A quick Google search even turns up automerge-repo-rs, which includes a WebSocket handler for Axum
â€” perfect!

Not quite. A diligent developer would first inspect the tests before diving into implementation. If you
did that, you'd quickly notice that automerge-repo-rs is tested against automerge-repo 0.1.2, while we
are using 1.2.1, which is completely incompatible. That developer might also notice the cruel joke that
the protocol version is only checked by the server, meaning an up-to-date client will happily complete
the initial handshake with an outdated server.

Further investigation reveals that automerge-repo and automerge-repo-rs have significantly diverging
APIs, effectively forming separate ecosystems.

### Alternatives to Hosting the Node.js Automerge Server

1. Downgrade the Client to Automerge Repo 0.1.2
- This would break several things, though some might be fixable
- However, it would likely lock us into an outdated version indefinitely, which is obviously undesirable

2. Port the Node.js Server to Rust
- The server consists of fewer than 2,000 lines of TypeScript, which seems manageable
- An LLM could assist with the porting process, and we could reuse the existing tests
- However, maintaining this in Rust would introduce additional complexity, particularly given our current codebase
- This would be some tricky Rust code, especially in comparison to the existing codebase
- While this might be worth considering in the future, the opportunity cost seems high for now
