# CatColab document sync server

This package provides the [Automerge](https://automerge.org/) document sync
server for CatColab, written in TypeScript as a thin wrapper around
[`automerge-repo`](https://github.com/automerge/automerge-repo).

It is not very useful on its own and is intended to run in conjunction with the
CatColab [backend](../backend/). See there for more information.
