/*! Virtual double graphs.

Analogous to how a graph is the combinatorial data that underlies a category, a
*virtual double graph* (nonstandard term) is the combinatorial data that
underlies a virtual double category.

In Leinster's terminology, a virtual double graph is called an *fc-graph*
([Leinster 2004](crate::refs::HigherOperads), Section 5.1). A virtual double
graph is similar to a *double graph*, or two-dimensional semi-cubical set,
except that the top boundary is a directed path of proedges rather than a single
proedge.

/** A virtual double graph, the data underlying a virtual double category.

Following our nomenclature for double categories, we say that an edge in a
double graph has a *domain* and *codomain*, whereas a proedge has a *source* and
a *target*. A square has all four of those.
