//! Diagrams in models of a double theory.
//!
//! A **diagram** in a [model](super::model) is simply a
//! [morphism](super::model_morphism) into that model. This includes the domain of
//! that morphism, which is assumed to be a free model.
//!
//! Diagrams are currently used primarily to represent instances of models from a
//! fibered perspective, generalizing how a diagram in a category can be used to
//! represent a copresheaf over that category.
