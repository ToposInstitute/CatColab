/*! Models of double theories.

A model of a double theory is a category (or categories) equipped with
operations specified by the theory, categorifying the familiar idea from logic
that a model of a theory is a set (or sets) equipped with operations. For
background on double theories, see the [`theory`](super::theory) module.

In the case of a *simple* double theory, which amounts to a small double
category, a **model** of the theory is a span-valued *lax* double functor out of
the theory. Such a model is a "lax copresheaf," categorifying the notion of a
copresheaf or set-valued functor. Though they are "just" lax double functors,
models come with extra intuitions. To bring that out we introduce new jargon,
building on that for double theories.

# Terminology

A model of a double theory consists of elements of two kinds:

1. **Objects**, each assigned an object type in the theory;

2. **Morphisms**, each having a domain and a codomain object and assigned a
   morphism type in the theory, compatibly with the domain and codomain types;

In addition, a model has the following operations:

- **Object action**: object operations in the theory act on objects in the model
  to produce new objects;

- **Morphism action**: morphism operations in the theory act on morphisms in
  the model to produce new morphisms, compatibly with the object action;

- **Composition**: a path of morphisms in the model has a composite morphism,
  whose type is the composite of the corresponding morphism types.

/** A model of a double theory.

As always in logic, a model makes sense only relative to a theory, but a theory
can have many different models. So, in Rust, a model needs access to its theory
but should not *own* its theory. Implementors of this trait might use an
immutable shared reference to the theory.

Objects and morphisms in a model are typed by object types and morphism types in
the theory. There is a design choice about whether identifiers for objects
([`Ob`](Category::Ob)) and morphisms ([`Mor`](Category::Mor)) are unique
relative to their types or globally within the model. If we took the first
approach (as we do in the Julia package
[ACSets.jl](https://github.com/AlgebraicJulia/ACSets.jl)), one could only make
sense of objects and morphisms when their types are known, so the early methods
in the trait would look like this:

```ignore
fn has_ob(&self, x: &Self::Ob, t: &Self::ObType) -> bool;
fn has_mor(&self, m: &Self::Mor, t: &Self::MorType) -> bool;
fn dom(&self, m: &Self::Mor, t: &Self::MorType) -> Self::Ob;
fn cod(&self, m: &Self::Mor, t: &Self::MorType) -> Self::Ob;
```

It will be more convenient for us to take the second approach since in our usage
object and morphism identifiers will be globally unique in a very strong sense
(something like UUIDs).
