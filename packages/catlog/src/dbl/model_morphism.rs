/*! Morphisms between models of double theories.

A morphism between [models](super::model) consists of functions between objects
and between morphisms that are:

1. *Well-typed*: preserve object and morphism types
2. *Functorial*: preserve composition and identities
3. *Natural*: commute with object operations and morphism operations, possibly up
   to comparison maps

In mathematical terms, a model morphism is a natural transformation between lax
double functors. The natural transformation can be strict, pseudo, lax, or
oplax. For models of *discrete* double theories, all these options coincide.
