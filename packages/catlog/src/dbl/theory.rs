/*! Double theories.

A double theory specifies a categorical structure, meaning a category (or
categories) equipped with extra structure. The spirit of the formalism is that a
double theory is "just" a [virtual double category](super::category),
categorifying Lawvere's idea that a theory is "just" a category. Thus, a double
theory is a [concept with an
attitude](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/concept+with+an+attitude). To bring out
these intuitions, the interface for double theories, [`DblTheory`], introduces
new terminology compared to the references cited below.

# Terminology

A double theory comprises four kinds of things:

1. **Object type**, interpreted in models as a set of objects.

2. **Morphism type**, having a source and a target object type and interpreted
   in models as a span of morphisms (or
   [heteromorphisms](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/heteromorphism)) between sets
   of objects.

3. **Object operation**, interpreted in models as a function between sets of
   objects.

4. **Morphism operation**, having a source and target object operation and
   interpreted in models as map between spans of morphisms.

The dictionary between the type-theoretic and double-categorical terminology is
summarized by the table:

| Associated type                 | Double theory      | Double category           | Interpreted as |
|---------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|----------------|
| [`ObType`](DblTheory::ObType)   | Object type        | Object                    | Set            |
| [`MorType`](DblTheory::MorType) | Morphism type      | Proarrow (loose morphism) | Span           |
| [`ObOp`](DblTheory::ObOp)       | Object operation   | Arrow (tight morphism)    | Function       |
| [`MorOp`](DblTheory::MorOp)     | Morphism operation | Cell                      | Map of spans   |

Models of a double theory are *categorical* structures, rather than merely
*set-theoretical* ones, because each object type is assigned not just a set of
objects but also a span of morphisms between those objects, constituting a
category. The morphisms come from a distinguished "Hom" morphism type for each
object type in the double theory. Similarly, each object operation is not just a
function but a functor because it comes with an "Hom" operation between the Hom
types. Moreover, morphism types can be composed to give new ones, as summarized
by the table:

| Method                                      | Double theory          | Double category        |
|---------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| [`hom_type`](DblTheory::hom_type)           | Hom type               | Identity proarrow      |
| [`hom_op`](DblTheory::hom_op)               | Hom operation          | Identity cell on arrow |
| [`compose_types`](DblTheory::compose_types) | Compose morphism types | Compose proarrows      |

Finally, operations on both objects and morphisms have identities and can be
composed:

| Method                                          | Double theory                       | Double category           |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| [`id_ob_op`](DblTheory::id_ob_op)               | Identity operation on object type   | Identity arrow            |
| [`id_mor_op`](DblTheory::id_mor_op)             | Identity operation on morphism type | Identity cell on proarrow |
| [`compose_ob_ops`](DblTheory::compose_ob_ops)   | Compose object operations           | Compose arrows            |
| [`compose_mor_ops`](DblTheory::compose_mor_ops) | Compose morphism operations         | Compose cells             |
