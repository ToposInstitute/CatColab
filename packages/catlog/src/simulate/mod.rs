//! Simulation of dynamical systems.
//!
//! "Modeling and simulation" is a major part of science and engineering. The
//! purpose of the `catlog` crate is to specify models using the machinery of
//! double-categorical logic. This module simulates dynamical systems derived from
//! models. It is intended as a stopgap solution pending interoperation with a
//! language having a better scientific computing ecosystem than Rust, such as
//! Julia. If this code does stick around it should eventually become its own crate.
//! For now it's convenient to keep everything in the same place.
