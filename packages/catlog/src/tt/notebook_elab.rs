// There is some infrastructure that needs to be put into place before
// notebook elaboration can be fully successful.
//
// First of all, we need an error reporting strategy adapted for the
// notebook interface.
//
// As a first pass, we will associate the cell uuid with errors. I think
// that it makes sense to have an entirely separate file for notebook
// elaboration, mainly because the error reporting is going to be so
// different.
//
// Another reason for a separate file is that we can handle the caching
// there. Ideally, actually, the existing `Toplevel` struct should work
// just fine.
//
// It is also desirable to extract a "partial model" from a notebook.
// I think that this is possible if we simply ignore any cells that have
// errors, including cells that depend on cells that have errors.
