        # The github action cache is limited to 10GB and the compressed nix store for this project is
        # typically around 3GB. As a result, it is very easy to thrash the cache by when using
        # using hashed cache keys. This results in "useful" caches being evicted.
        # 
        # NOTE: The above does not fully explain some issues we've had with cache misses. We've had
        # back-to-back runs with the same key fail to find a cache, when the same key matched a cache
        # days before. The current solution addresses this issue as well.
        #
        # To work around this, we always reuse the same cache and rely on nix garbage collection for
        # keeping that cache a reasonable size.
        #
        # There is a degenerate case: where parallel development uses different flake inputs (like the
        # NixOS versions). Each job's garbage collection will prune store paths not tied to that job's
        # inputs. As a result, branches with differing inputs may end up with almost no cached data. This
        # case should not come up that often, and when it does it will result in some ~15min CI times.

        # Since we are manually updating the cache, and we don't know if the cache has changed so we need
        # to purge the existing cache and re-upload it on every run.
        #
        # NOTE: the cache will always change if any of the rust or automerge packages have changed, since
        # their outputs would be included in /nix/store. Not uploading the cache every time would save
        # 30-90s in CI, however I don't think it makes sense to optimize for the case when only the
        # frontend changes, and doing anything more complicated is a non-trivial amount of work.
