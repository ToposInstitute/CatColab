        # The github action cache is limited to 10GB and the compressed nix store for this project is
        # typically between 3GB and 5GB, as a result it is very easy to thrash the cache by when using
        # using hashed cache keys. This results in "useful" caches being evicted.
        # 
        # NOTE: The above does not fully explain some issues we've had with cache misses. We've had
        # back-to-back runs with the exact same key fail to find a cache, when the same key matched a
        # cache days before.
        #
        # To work around this, we always reuse the same cache and rely on nix garbage collection for
        # keeping that cache a reasonable size.
        #
        # There is a degenerate case: where parallel development uses different flake inputs (like the
        # NixOS versions). Each job's garbage collection will prune store paths not tied to that job's
        # inputs. As a result, branches with differing inputs may end up with almost no cached data.

        # CI times.

        # figured out how to skip the purge + re-upload when no garbage is collected.
